# Question_Answering_System
A Question Answering (QA) system uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning to understand user queries and return precise answers. It processes the question, retrieves relevant context from sources like Wikipedia or documents, and uses transformer-based models to generate accurate responses. Voice input can also be integrated.
